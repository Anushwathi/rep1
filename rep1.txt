Algorithm to find minimum among the given 3 numbers:
STEP 1: Start the program
STEP 2: Read the three numbers A value, B value, C value
STEP 3: IF A value less than B value and A value is less than C value, Display A is minimum
STEP 4: IF B value is less than C value and B value is less than A value, Display B is minimum
STEP 5: IF C value is less than A value and C value is less than B value, Display C is minimum
STEP 6: Stop the program
